A new Library created for optimzing compatiblity & Connection between
All of Project Next's projects.

Keep in Mind this is an UNOFFICIAL Repositories forked from the official

maintained repositories. We will try to keep this repo as up to date as
possible. Rolling updates before the official repositories. And publishing
nightly builds.
